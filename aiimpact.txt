AI Impact Statement

Tasks automated/augmented:
- AI-powered chat therapy providing 24/7 empathetic responses to mental health queries
- Real-time emotion analysis from text and voice inputs
- Automated conversation context management and personalized therapeutic responses
- Voice-based therapy sessions with speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion
- Content filtering and topic validation to ensure mental health focus

Model(s) used & justification:
- Groq's Llama 3.1 8B Instant model for chat responses: Fast inference, cost-effective, and optimized for conversational AI with empathetic responses
- Custom prompt-completion matching system for consistent, validated responses
- Web Speech API for browser-based speech recognition and synthesis

Data provenance & licenses:
- User-generated content: Chat messages, emotion entries, event data (proprietary, user-owned)
- Seeded therapist and event data: Created for demonstration (proprietary)
- Groq API: Apache 2.0 License
- Prompt completions database: Curated mental health responses (proprietary)
- No training data collected; all data used for inference only

Guardrails & evaluation plan:
- Content filtering: Profanity detection and mental health topic validation before AI processing
- System prompts enforce mental health-only focus with explicit redirection rules
- No medical diagnoses; clear disclaimers that AI is not a substitute for professional therapy
- Regular monitoring of AI responses for bias, hallucinations, and inappropriate content
- User feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs

Expected user/business/safety impact:
- Positive: 24/7 accessible mental health support, reduced barriers to care, stigma-free environment
- Safety: Content filtering prevents inappropriate interactions; clear boundaries prevent medical advice
- Business: Scalable mental health support platform with potential for therapist booking integration
- Risk mitigation: Clear disclaimers, professional boundaries, and redirect to human therapists when needed
